I first started off with linking the external CSS fileand setting up basic styles such as font family, background color, and page margins. From there I worked section by section, making sure everything looked as similar to the screenshot as possible before moving on to the next section. What was challenging for me was the quiz section and the table for the common octopus species. I felt both of these sections required many things to accomplish it and it took so much time to have the end result. I kept adjusting the padding, margin, and border. What was especially hard to get was octopus image positioning. It kept messing with the layout and had to go back to the preclass assignments to solve it. I found setting the quiz container to positive: relative and the image to position: absolute made the layout be like the screenshot. And I had the same issue with the table I wasn't sure what to do for the border and with what was provided in the preclass asignments border-collapse: collapse worked for this.
